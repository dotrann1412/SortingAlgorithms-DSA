# Sorting Algorithms

## General
This is a medium exercise of Data Structures and Algorithms courses and I have to implement 11 sorting algorithms.
I'm not copied any of the code version on the internet, I just read the main idea of the algorithms and implement it on my own.
Sorry if my code is hard to understand but if you detect bugs in my implementation, tell me!

## How to run
To re-compile the program, I give you a Batchfile to quickly use whenever you want.
This program runs on Terminal/Command Promt with command parameters.
For more all about the commands try: `[execuable-file] --help`.
Make sure the Terminal/Command Prompt was opened with the right directory.

## Project structure
- `main.cpp`: include entry point of the program.
- `sorting_algorithms/*`: the heart of this project.
- `util/*`: declaration of all of related functions used on the program.
- `data/*`: sample input file - mapped on .data_mapping.
- Files started with a dot `.`: save all configuration data for the program.

## Note
Shouldn't copy my code if you don't know how it runs!
